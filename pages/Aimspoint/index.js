                    The professional team of OSL began the process by getting an
                    idea from the client’s previous website on Wix. Our client
                    had initially a Wix-based website that was not getting much
                    attention on the search engines. That is why; the team of
                    our developers established the new website of AIMSPOINT on
                    WordPress to make it super functional. We added some new
                    features to lift the client’s website:

                    The previous website of Aimspoint was a little outdated so
                    it was necessary to make some improvements to enhance the
                    look and performance of the website. So our experts added
                    the essence of authenticity because we knew that the core
                    business is about selling construction safety products.

                    Therefore, we organized the website pages in a way to view
                    all the objects accordingly with the usage of the right
                    theme and color combination.
