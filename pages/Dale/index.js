                  Our professionals are experts to move from an app idea to
                  launching an application. We are completely focused on
                  creating a highly scalable, flexible, and safe banking
                  application. Our developers began to design the workflow while
                  the others started working on the real need of the client to
                  create a user-friendly app. With the help of experience in
                  generating integrated mobile applications, OSL developed an
                  application that can resolve all the complex module-related
                  issues.

                  Daleâ€™s project was one of the complicated for OSL but we
                  managed it professionally and begin scrum development on

                  start and end dates were mentioned. The team divided the tasks
                  and handled the development phase accordingly. The application
                  was designed for different types of users that include
                  customers and merchants.

                  installed API and a Dale button to diverse E-commerce stores
                  so that the consumer can easily pay and buy from any online
